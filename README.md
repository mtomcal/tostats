Trance Out Stats Daemon
===========

In 2012, I had a basic statistics class where we were charged to devise a final project based on real data. I decided I wanted to create a bot that sat on the Trance music channel on Turntable.fm website (before it shut its doors recently). I used CoffeeScript, the Americano web framework I developed for a previous job, and the Turntable JS API. I collected a ton of data where I produced a meaningful statistically significant project.
